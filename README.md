## `üóûÔ∏è CICADA DRAINER:` is the most modern drainer available on the market. It supports seven of the most popular networks: Ethereum, BNB SmartChain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrium, Phantom and Optimism. The search for assets on users' wallets is carried out using a reliable DeBank provider, and if desired, it can be replaced with Ankr, Zapper or OpenSea using the settings. The trainer successfully copes with finding the main coin of the wallet, ERC-20 tokens and NFT, which he also successfully outputs in fully automatic mode.

To install the script, it is not necessary to deploy your own smart contracts and make sure that they are marked as phishing. The script is able to function both without smart contracts at all and with a specialized public contract, which avoids all the difficulties of creating your own contract, paying various kinds of commissions and connections. The contract is very flexible and supports several types of events that you can trigger on your site: Security Update, Claim, Claim Reward, Execute, Connect, Swap. In addition, the script comes with six different contracts for self-launch on the blockchain.

## `üï∏Ô∏è WORKING PRINCIPLE üï∏Ô∏è` The most expensive assets are written off first, then the cheapest. At the same time, the script builds a smart queue that is not limited to either the network or the type of resource. At the same time, the smart settlement system takes into account the resources needed to pay the network commission, which allows you to squeeze everything possible out of the user's wallet and send it to you. It is also possible to personally set priorities in the script, for example, to first write off tokens that support PERMIT, or those that can be withdrawn using exchangers. Several methods of token withdrawal and NFT are available in the script at once, which can be easily configured for your purposes: tokens can be withdrawn by direct transfer, through confirmation, by calling PERMIT, using exchangers, as well as using an invisible signature. Depending on the wallet selected by the user, the most suitable method will be selected for him. By default, the most inconspicuous and effective one is selected. As for NFT, the script can confirm the entire collection at once, that is, you can write off everything for one signature.

## Automatic withdrawal of approved assets is supported: after the user gives confirmation, signs a PERMIT, or gives access to the entire NFT collection, the script, if technically possible, independently, without any of your actions, will write off these assets and transfer them to your wallet. In order for this function to work correctly, there should always be a little coin on the drainer's wallet.
## The script supports a huge number of wallets, more than 300 pieces, to be more precise. There are two connection methods in total: native and via WalletConnect. Native wallets work with the trainer directly, including: MetaMask, Coinbase, Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet. You can connect other wallets via WalletConnect by scanning the QR code on the screen from your mobile device, or by opening the website from your phone and selecting a wallet from the list of those installed on your phone. Most mobile wallets support WalletConnect. Works with both versions of WalletConnect.
